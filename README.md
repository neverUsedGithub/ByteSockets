# ByteSockets

ByteSockets is a layer built on top of WebSockets. It reduces the size of sent messages by serializing them using my byte encoder library and performs schema validation with zod.

# Documentation

There is currently no documentation available as the library is still in its early stages of development, but you can find an example in the `tests` directory.
